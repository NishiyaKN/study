	- Southbridge - slow speed data: HDD, BIOS, PCI, peripherals
 - **Form factors**
	 - ATX - most used, 20 pin connector

	 - ITX - small, uses little power
	 - Mini ITX - used in thin clients
---
### CPU
- **Architectures**
	- PGA - pin grid array, pins are in the CPU package
	- LGA - land grid array, pins are in the socket
 ---
### Memory - cnp
- **ROM**
	Directly accessed by the CPU, stores basic operation instructions such as boot
	- ROM - Read-Only Memory
	- PROM - Programmable ROM
	- EPROM - Erasable PROM, erased by UV light exposure
	- EEPROM - Electrically EPROM, used for BIOS
		- Flash Memroy is an upgrade from EEPROM
- **RAM**
	Acessed by programs used by the CPU
	- DRAM - Dynamic RAM, used for main memory
	- SRAM - Static RAM, cache memory, low power, much faster than DRAM
	- SDRAM - Synchronous Dynamic RAM, high transfer rates
	- DDR SDRAM - Double Data Rate SDRAM, each gen is faster, uses less power, has more pins, etc. 
	- GDDR RAM - Graphics, GPU
- **Modules**
	Memory modules can be single-sided or double-sided.
	- DIP - Dual Inline Package
	- SIMM - Single Inline Memory Module, small circuit board that holds sevelra memory chips
	- DIMM - Dual Inline Memory Module, holds SDRAM chips
	- SODIMM - Small Outline DIMM, used on laptops, printers and small devices
	- RDDIM -  memória com buffer, que permite uma maior quantidade de RAM mas uma velocidade reduzida. Ela possui um controlador que faz o gerenciamento de grandes quantidades da RAM. Mais comum em servers e workstations
 - **Memory errors**
	 - Nonparity - doesn't check for errors, most common for home and business workstations
	 - Parity - contains eight bits for data and one for error checking (parity bit)
	 - ECC - Error Correction Code memory can detec multiple bit errors and correct single bit errors, used on financial or data analytics servers
 ___
### Hard Disk Drives
- **Magnetic**
	- HDD
		- 1.8'
		- 2.5'
		- 3.5'
	- Tape - used for archiving
 - **Solid State**
	- Disc drive - like HDD, 1,8', 2.5' ,3.5'
	- Expasion cards - plugged directly into the motherboard
	- mSata (M.2) - use a special socket

- Memoria buffer é comumente utilizada em servidores
- 5,25" - unidade optica
- PSU fica assegurada por parafusos
- PCIe é serial, PCI é paralelo
- Adaptador de vídeo (GPU) deve precisar de dois conectores de energia de 8 pinos
- Finalidade de um "espelho" I/O é tornar as portas I/O da mobo disponíveis para conexão para uma variedade de gabinetes
- CPU e RAM conectados pelo barramento frontal 
___
# Chapter 3
### POST
Means power-on self-test, and is a **hardware check** performed by the BIOS on boot. Whenever some hardware fails, it will beep x times corresponding to the hardware fail beep code defined by the manufacturer 
### BIOS
- Is a small program contained inside a ROM chip on the motherboard, which controls communication between the OS and the hardware.
- It's settings are saved on a CMOS memory chip.
- When booted, the BIOS look for the configuration set on the CMOS.
- CMOS uses a watch battery
### UEFI
Unified Extensible Firmware Interface, provides additional features and better security compared with legacy BIOS.
Can run on 32-bit and 64-bit systems, support larger boot drives and have things like secure boot. 
Secure boot faz com que apenas sistemas operacionais e drivers confiáveis sejam bootados
### Security features
- Passwords - allows for different levels of access to the BIOS settings
- Drive encryption
- LoJack - locate, lock and delete
- TPM - Trusted Platform Module - chip that stores encyption keys, digital certificates, password and data. Used by BitLocker's full disk encryption
- Secure boot - computer will only boot an OS trusted by the motherboard manufacturer
### Power Fluctuation Types
Unsteady voltages 
 - Blackout - Complete loss of AC power
 - Brownout - Drops below 80% of the normal voltage level or is overloaded
 - Noise - Interferences form generators and lightning (poor quality power)
 - Spike - Sudden increase of voltage, over 100% of normal levels, caused by lightning or when electrical system comes backs
 - Power surge - Dramatic increase in voltage, lasts for a few nanoseconds
### Power Protection Devices
- Surge protector - protects from surge and spikes, diverts extra voltage to the ground
- UPS - Uninterruptible power supply, supplies a **consistent** level of power to a device. Helps on blackouts or brownouts. 
- SPS- Standby power supply, provides a backup battery when voltage drops below the normal level. Not reliable as UPS since it takes time to switch and if may fail.
### CPU Architectures
CPU executes programs (sequence of stored instructions) by following a specific instrcutions set:
- RISC - Reduced Instruction Set Computer, have very small instructions, designed to execute them rapidly. E.g, ARM, PowerPC.
- CISC - Complex Instruction Set Computer, uses a broad set of instructions, fewer steps. E.g., Intel x86.
### CPU Operation
- Hyper-Threading - multiple pieces of code (threads) are executed simultaneously in the CPU. It's like there are multiple CPUs
- HyperTransport - high-speed connection between the CPU and Northbridge chip
The amount of data that a CPU can process at one time depends on the size of the [[FSB]]. 
### Multicore
- Cache L2 e L3 normalmente são separados, L1 é compartilhada
- Multicore usa menos energia e produz menos calor que singlecore
-
